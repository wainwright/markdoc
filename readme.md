Markdoc
=======

A simple tool for generating good looking documents from markdown with minimal
effort.  Basically creating HTML from markdown, but adding some in-line CSS.

Rather than firing up a word processor, this allows me to create a nice-looking
document, that I can produce quickly with markdown, and distribute in a single
file.

CSS based on that by Florian Wolters
[here](http://github.com/FlorianWolters/jekyll-bootstrap-theme).

Usage
-----
    markdoc -o output.html input.markdown
